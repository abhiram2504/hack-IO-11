# Detecting Anomalies in Water Quality for OSU's Carbon Footprint Reduction

## Introduction

Clean and reliable water is essential for any community, and The Ohio State University is committed to maintaining the highest water quality standards. We propose an innovative initiative that focuses on detecting anomalies in water quality, drawing inspiration from the need for precise anomaly detection in Alameda County, California. Our project aims to identify deviations in water quality data, and by doing so, we can efficiently address these anomalies. This data-driven approach aligns with OSU's goal to reduce its carbon footprint by 25% by 2025, as it helps us identify areas where environmental factors may be contributing to anomalies.

## Background

Alameda County, California, has provided valuable insights into the importance of identifying anomalies in water quality data as part of broader environmental efforts.

## Project Proposal for OSU

### Anomaly Detection and Carbon Footprint Reduction

- **Data Integration:** Integrate data on water quality, air quality, waste management, and electricity usage to provide a comprehensive view of environmental conditions on campus.

- **Anomaly Detection Model:** Develop a robust anomaly detection model that identifies deviations in water quality parameters, especially those potentially linked to increased carbon emissions.

- **Response and Carbon Reduction:** When anomalies are detected, implement a rapid response protocol to address anomalies efficiently in order to reduce the carbon footprint by 25% by 2025.

### Sustainable Campus Practices

- **Emission Reduction Measures:** Implement targeted measures to reduce emissions from various campus activities that may contribute to anomalies in water quality data.

- **Energy Efficiency:** Enhance energy efficiency across campus to minimize potential environmental factors impacting water quality and carbon emissions.

## Long-Term Commitment

This project represents a long-term commitment to maintaining water quality and efficiently addressing anomalies. The focus on anomaly detection aligns with OSU's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint by 25% by 2025, helping us achieve this sustainability goal.

## Conclusion

By focusing on detecting anomalies in water quality data, we are taking a proactive and data-driven approach to maintain and improve environmental conditions on campus. With the current model we have on water quality, and the ones we are creating for air quality, waste management and electricity usage, we will be able to assist in reducing the carbon footprint, thereby addressing OSU's sustainability goals. By setting an example for other institutions and ensuring a safer and more environmentally friendly future, we can successfully identify, address, and prevent anomalies, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable environment for all.
